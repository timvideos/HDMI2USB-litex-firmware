class DataCapture(Module, AutoCSR):

    """
    Migen module for capturing VGA data from AD9984A on VGA expansion board.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pads : Record
        Vga pads from atlys platform

    Attributes
    ----------
    r,g, b : Signal(8-bit), out
             Each 8-bit wide signals for 3 color components of every pixel
    vsync  : Signal(1), out
             VSYNC signal. Generally used to signal sof
    de     : Signal 1-bit, out
             Data enable signal. Asserted means visible/active region is being
             captured at that moment
    valid  : Signal(1), out
             Data is valid. This should go high when AD9984A has been properly
             initialized.

    Clock Domains
    -------------
    pix : pixel clock domain
        All synchronous code in this module work on `pix` clock domain.
        No need to use RenameClockDomain

    Working
    -------
    This module runs two counters, `counterX` and `counterY`. `counterX` is reset at
    the rising edge of HSYNC signal from AD9984A, and then is counted up at every
    rising edge of pixel clock. `counterY` is reset at rising edge of VSYNC signal
    and is counted up at every HSYNC occurrence. `de` signal is asserted whenever
    data captured is from visible region. VGA timing constants decide visible region.

    TODO
    ----
    1. Make the timing values, which are currently constants, to configurable via
       CSRs.
    2. `valid` signal should be proper. Currently it just driven high always.
       But when support for configurable resolutions is added, we should wait for
       AD9984A IC's PLL to get locked and initialization to finish properly before
       driving this signal high.
