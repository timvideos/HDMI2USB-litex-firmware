# Cypress FX2 Firmware

This directory contains the FX2 firmware for the HDMI2USB project. It uses the
Open Source fx2lib, a free reimplementation of the Cypress support library.

The firmware is responsible for transporting the video data off of the FPGA. It
does this by enumerating as a USB Video Class device; a standard way of
interfacing devices such as webcams to a host. Linux, Windows and OS X all
include support out of the box for reading taking to such devices.

The firmware is also used for control and debugging of the system, through a
USB Communications Class Device. This is a common way of attaching serial ports
to the system, and under Linux it can be accessed at /dev/ttyUSBX.

# Building

The firmware uses the Open Source fx2lib, which will be downloaded as part of
the build process.

The build process requires git, make and sdcc. SDCC, the Small Device C
Compiler, is packaged in Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, as well as
Fedora:

`sudo apt-get install sdcc`
`sudo yum install sdcc`

`make`

# Flasing

Use fx2loader from the libfpgalink project:

`fx2loader -v 0925:3881 firmware.hex ram`


## Existing HDMI2USB USB endpoint usage
