# The Cypress FX2 is a programmable USB interface chip found on the Atlys and
# Opsis board (and many other devices out there).
#
# The IC is an 8051 core with a hardware support for the USB protocol. Firmware
# for the FX2 is developed using the fx2lib library and compiled with the SDCC
# compiler.
#
# The firmware can be loaded via USB using a number of tools such as fxload or
# fpgalink. Loading new firmware will cause the FX2 to disconnect and then
# reconnect to the USB bus, often causing it to change USB IDs and device
# files.
#
# Being a programmable device, the FX2 can emulate many other USB devices. We
# use it to emulate a USB UVC Webcam and a USB CDC-ACM serial port.
